“It all started when our predictably heroic protagonist, Jeff Breakfast, woke up in a haunted thicket. It was the third time it had happened. Feeling abnormally relieved, Jeff Breakfast stroked a live hand grenade, thinking it would make him feel better (but as usual, it did not). Duly ecstatic about the looming crises, he realized that his beloved iPhone was missing!  Immediately he called his fundamentalist, guilt-dispensing friend, Stephanie Toast. Jeff Breakfast had known Stephanie Toast for (plus or minus) 153 years, the majority of which were striking ones.  Stephanie Toast was unique. She was outgoing though sometimes a little... selfish. Jeff Breakfast called her anyway, for the situation was urgent.

Before she could come up with any reasonable ideas, Stephanie Toast was interrupted by four annoying koalas that were lured by her iPhone. Stephanie Toast turned red; 'Not again', she thought. Feeling exasperated, she aimlessly reached for her carrot and deftly groped every last one of them. Apparently this was an adequate deterrent--the discouraged critters began to scurry back toward the haunted thicket, squealing with discontent. She exhaled with relief.  That's when she heard the golf cart rolling up.  It was Jeff Breakfast.

Why was Stephanie Toast trying to distract Jeff Breakfast?  Because she had snuck out from Jeff Breakfast's with the iPhone only eight days prior.  It was a flamboyant little iPhone... how could she resist? It didn't take long before Jeff Breakfast got back to the subject at hand: his iPhone. Stephanie Toast yawned. Relunctantly, Stephanie Toast invited him over, assuring him they'd find the iPhone.
